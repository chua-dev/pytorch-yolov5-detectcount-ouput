# Yolov5 + Deep Sort with PyTorch

## Summary if this RePo

1. Object Detetion Counting With Yolov5
2. I/O operations
3. Real-Time Supported but moderate Delay expected, if without GPU


## Introduction

This repository contains a two-stage-tracker. The detections generated by **YOLOv5**, a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to a **Deep Sort algorithm** which tracks the objects. It can track any object that your Yolov5 model was trained to detect.


## Use this Detector
